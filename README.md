**Aviary** is a project completed for **Practicum by Yandex's October Code Jam**. During the Code Jam, two web developers and one web designer came together over the course of three days to create an application that would help users stay grounded during the pandemic.

Our group designed and built **[Aviary](https://mccambley.github.io/hacktober-code-jam/)**, an application that allows users to pick a landscape and location to build a custom audiovisual experience containing images of the chosen landscape as well as the sounds of birds native to their chosen location.

### Check out a live demo of this project [here](https://youtu.be/6hlaG0G9euE).

## üì£ Overview

- Chose a location using the form on the **[landing page](https://mccambley.github.io/hacktober-code-jam/)**
- Or click the **player** link in the header to be taken to sample soundscape depicting the bird sounds of **Jackson, NH** with a **Mountain** backdrop
- From the **player**

### To Do:

- [x] Create complete this readme and create a more in-depth about page
- [ ] Connect skip buttons to audio rather than image
- [ ] Create some new button functionality for choosing a new image... or redesign skip buttons so as to not confuse them with audio functionality
- [ ] Allow for entry of place names rather than only zipcodes
- [ ] With 4, expand location beyond the united states
- [ ] Display images of birds in addition to the names on the player popup
- [ ] Make player progress bar something more functional, perhaps a volume slider
- [ ] UI fixes (close on overlay, make place options more obviously clickable etc.)
- [ ] Store previous calls in next buttons
- [ ] Consolidate to one page
- [ ] Add a random image button instead
- [ ] Certify the unsplash API to be able to get more than a hundred requests
- [ ] If no bird calls are returned then populate with a new zip code
- [ ] Troubleshoot if only three calls are returned
- [x] Add Fetch current location
- [x] convert Zipcode to location name using [this](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Lookup/)
