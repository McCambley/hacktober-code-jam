### To Do:

1. Make player progress bar something more functional, perhaps a volume slider
2. Connect skip buttons to audio rather than image
3. Create some new button functionality for choosing a new image... or redesign skip buttons so as to not confuse them with audio functionality
4. Allow for entry of place names rather than only zipcodes
5. With 4, expand location beyond the united states
6. Display images of birds in addition to the names on the player popup
7. Create a more in-depth about page and readme
8. UI fixes (close on overlay, make place options more obviously clickable etc.)
